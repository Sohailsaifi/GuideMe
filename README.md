# General idea:
GuideMe  pretends to bring closer adavtanges of the modern world to people who are not fully adapted to new techonologies.

# Our product:
We have developed an integral solution for the outdoor guidance of elderly or disabled people, offering a fully functional walking stick which provides clear and concise indications for guidance between points in the city, improving their quality of life.

# Future capabilities:
This GuideMe has room for improvement in many ways. It would be possible to link a public transport ticket to commute in the city or optimize the route to avoid slopes or rough sidewalks.

Also, it would be possible to track the location of the stick in real time to make interventions easier in case of emergency (or even include an emergency button to call the emergency services if required).

Using the live data of the Tampere city its realistic to send live information of the traffic lights, making sure that the user realises about the actual state of the traffic lights.

The system could be implemented as well in public buildings such as hospitals, train stations... having an indoor beacon-based guidance system.

Some extra features could be inductive charge and LED flashlight to improve visibility in dark areas.
